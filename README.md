# WASP Activity Recognition

Solution for the activity recognition  assignment of WASP course Autonomous Systems I

## Task Description

To do this assignment you will need access to a phone running Android, i.e. each group should have at least one person with an Android phone.

Download the (free) application Sensor Fusion from Google Play. It has been developed at LiU. More information is available here: http://sensorfusion.se/sfapp/ (Links to an external site.) (Links to an external site.)

 (Links to an external site.)Make sure you have read about sensor imperfection modelling in the self-study material. You might also like to check this video out (Links to an external site.), illustrating the problem with long-time accuracy when using the IMU only (accelerometer + gyro. Adding a compass/magnetometer helps only slightly)

Your task is to implement an "app" (it is ok if it runs offline on saved data) that does activity recognition based on the data from the phone's sensors.

**Requirements:** The algorithm should be able to discriminate between, standing still, walking and running. You don't have to implement the algorithm on the phone, you can work offline on collected data. Handin a presentation where your solution is presented as well as code+data.
